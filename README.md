# Foodordering_webapp_MERN

Project Overview
The food ordering website enables users to browse a menu, customize their orders, add items to a cart, and place orders. The MERN stack provides a highly efficient foundation, supporting all aspects of the application: MongoDB for the database, Express.js as the backend framework, React for the front-end interface, and Node.js to run the backend server.
